## ‚ú® New (AWESOME) feature üî•

* [`@phenomic/plugin-transform-markdown`: allow custom markup](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/1bd1d2f6f15a12082d07061bdc25d46aaae1b86f),

  [#817](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/817) &
  [#1098](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/1098)) This plugin now use
  [unified](http://unifiedjs.github.io) directly instead of
  [remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark) so we can mix remark with
  [rehype](https://github.com/wooorm/rehype) to allow custom markup. This will
  open up usage of custom react components when rendering markdown tree with a
  custom mapping. Anchor that was present by default have been removed. We will
  introduce in next release a support for custom plugin passed from the config
  to add it back.
