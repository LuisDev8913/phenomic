# Stable 1.0.0, we are almost there!

This release is probably the penultimate before the stable release. It brings us
2 majors things:

* üéâ For React users, 2 methods, supported via the new `withInitialProps` HOC,
  allows you to consume any kind of data (not just Phenomic API but any kind of
  REST APIs, GraphQL APIs for CMS etc) via `static async getInitialProps()`.
  This API, inspired by Next.js is not alone as it comes with another new method
  for the pre-rendering step, called `static async getAllPossibleUrls()`.
* üí™ We adjusted 2 transform plugins (markdown and asciidoc) so you can directly
  pass to those the [unified](https://unifiedjs.github.io) plugins you want to
  use.

This release is an important step for us as it brings us our missing pieces to
be happy with Phenomic current state. Stay tuned for the final release, that
will be done at the same time as we will publish documentations on the website.

ü§© We also created a new
[react-app-blog](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/examples/react-app-blog)
example that you can use as a good starting point to create any site (not only a
blog - and we plan to push more examples when we will hit stable 1.0.0). This
starter includes some pages, some posts, and the usage of our new fresh API to
create pages from github data (but you can just use this and replace with any
kind of API) to generate client side and static generated pages from those data!
For the architecture, we used something simple, with a few components for
header/footer with differents layouts etc. We also included a standard error
page (used for 404). For the styling, we didn't wanted to do something too
opinionated and also something too old school (CSS in dedicated files since we
all love CSS-in-JS), so we took an simple approach in the middle, with a CSS
style tags per components. This allows CSS lover to just extract the CSS in
files, and CSS-in-JS lovers to easily convert in places the styles. Remember
that we have
[plenty of examples to know how to handle CSS via any kind of solutions](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/examples).
You will find a visual preview at the end of this post.
