* [`@phenomic/plugin-renderer-react`: **Improve Link behavior for better accessibility (respect modifiers, target + keyboard navigation)**](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/5b7422465c7755e51ef07bac1a53a6bcaf4610ab),
  by @MoOx

  The Link component (by default used to navigate between content (eg: markdown)
  link) has been improved:

  * does not use directly react-router Link, but instead just push the url in
    the navigation history (which is supported by react-router)
  * respect target=_blank original behavior
  * respect keyboard modifiers original behaviors (eg: cmd+click, alt+click etc)
  * work better with keyboard navigation (enter key) has it's now triggering
    client side navigation!

  This component can receive onClick and onPress callback that can trigger a
  preventDefault() to avoid the original behavior of the component if necessary.
