- üêõ `@phenomic/core`: various regression to database introduced in
  `v1.0.0-alpha.14` by @MoOx

* üí•
  [`@phenomic/plugin-collector-files`: remove specific code for `author` field automatically associated with `authors` in the database](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/2e2b3e17e21a51c933e4437be7e92b7eeac55778),
  by @MoOx

If you were previously relying on the fact that the meta `author` from a file
was magically resolved to a possible `authors` from your database, you should
instead rely on the generic behavior that works with identical names. This means
you should change `author: "name"` to `authors: ["name"]`. This will produce the
same magic resolution when retrieving content from a single (`id` based) query.
If you really want the old behavior back, we should think about a generic
solution. So please open an issue.
