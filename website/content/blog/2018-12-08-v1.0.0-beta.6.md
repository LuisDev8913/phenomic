## Erratums

- Until beta.7 is release, please (npm install/yarn add) `@babel/core` to your
  project.
- Reason users: you will night to replace `*.js` by `*.bs.js` for some files Eg:
  `import { createContainer } from "@phenomic/preset-react-app/lib/es6/src/phenomicPresetReactApp.js";`
  to
  `import { createContainer } from "@phenomic/preset-react-app/lib/es6/src/phenomicPresetReactApp.bs.js";`

## üö® Breaking change (if you use custom babel config)

- [Upgrade from babel 6 to babel 7](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/bb0ce41b4fde26fbe4230601f3c39a6a442e873e)
  ([+fixup](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/09525f2058788030132026050a7cf55cab61527a)).

‚ö†Ô∏è If you were using phenomic without any custom babel config, this update
should be transparent for you.
