# üí• Includes _Breaking changes_ for Reason users.

This release is mostly a bunch of improvements (with a minor breaking change)
for Reason users in addition to a bugfix for an edge case.

## üí• Breaking changes (Reason only)

- [`@phenomic/plugin-renderer-react`: (Reason) `jsEdgeToReason` is now `jsEdge`](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/6599f41d4139c430801b44a2e043b60f29a1f4bd),
  by @MoOx There is no transformation anymore. Transformation should be made in
  your component. This change is accompanied with a new type to help you (see
  `jsNodeList` type below). We highly recommend you to take a look to the
  updated example. See below for more details.

## üêõ Bugfixes

- [`@phenomic/core`: support query without path for prerendering as it‚Äôs supported by database](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/a32c7dbd095ba16c703e71d30a935f5d509db81f),
  by @MoOx

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation

- [`hasPreviousPage` & `hasNextPage` are deprecated](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/69361b82c856f30727ec5588b098f31831be5637),
  by @MoOx Please test directly the existence of `previous` and `next`. It will
  continue to work for a while, but will be remove some day. _This is to make it
  more straight forward to use pagination in Reason._

## üí™ Improvements

- [`@phenomic/core`: `previousPageIsFirst` now always return a value (`false` instead of `undefined`)](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/e12b53d464c005e8bf44d66a58099f886870aff8),
  by @MoOx _This is to make it more straight forward to use pagination in
  Reason._

- [`@phenomic/plugin-renderer-react`: (Reason) expose `jsNodeList` type](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/3d0f24c7e96857d614d3ae1478ce59626f2ea65a),
  by @MoOx It is the type of data that comes from list queries.

## üëå Improved Example (Reason)

@MoOx worked a lot on the `examples/reason-react-app`:

- upgrade to reason-react 0.3.1
- we switched to es6 for bs generated files
- we added pagination, like in the JavaScript example
- we added react-helmet usage (via bs-react-helmet)
- we reorganized the code and added tiny helpers
