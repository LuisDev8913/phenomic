- Internal refactoring by @MoOx

Website has been a WIP for a few month now, mostly due to a break @MoOx took
from his keyboard.

Stable 1.0.0 is missing a change for the database engine that is currently
causing performance issues _during development_ as soon as you get a hundred of
pages. All efforts are currently on this improvement.

## For Reason users
