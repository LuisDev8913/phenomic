ðŸŽ‰ We added examples in `examples/*` for
[react-app](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/examples/react-app)
and
[reason-react-app](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/examples/reason-react-app).

We also have prepared a workflow to be able to quickly add more examples with
automated testing to prevent any kind of regressions. Documentation is also
covered by tests to prevent regressions.

Stay tuned for more examples. And do not hesitate to add some!

Do not hesitate to contact us if you want to contribute as our CONTRIBUTING.md
is still a WIP :)

# tl;dr;

* Tons of fixes in
  [Getting Started](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/blob/master/packages/preset-react-app/docs/getting-started/README.md)
* Fixed & improved pagination and static rendering
* Examples for preset-react-app & reason
* Client side navigation enabled for markdown link
* "Various fixes" ðŸ™ƒ

# Notable fixes & improvements

## `@phenomic/core`

* Fix static rendering for collection items (when no by param is used)
  ([#1114](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/1114) - @MoOx)

* Fix pagination `previous` that was incorrect for second page (@MoOx)

* Fix `order: 'asc'` for queries (@MoOx)

* Pre-rendering now handle ALL possible pages for pagination. This is a huge
  step forward as we now have a real immutable pagination that opens a number of
  possibilities like infinite scrolling mixed with immutable pages urls! (@MoOx,
  @bloodyowl)

## `@phenomic/plugin-public-assets`

* Prevent infinite static build step if no "public" folder exist (@MoOx)

## `@phenomic/plugin-bundler-webpack`

* Only shallow error if config file does not exist
  ([#1085](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/1085) - @MoOx)

## `@phenomic/plugin-renderer-react`

* New `Link` component that you should use instead of react-router v3 one. It
  enables client side routing for markdown by default and **also handle relative
  and external urls** unlike react-router v3 `Link`. (@MoOx)

## `@phenomic/preset-react-app`

* Update for Getting Started (@MoOx, @Izhaki, @nicolas-zozol, @andrwh, @soycode,
  @YuyingWu, @syndia)

## `@phenomic/reason`

* Various mysterious updates by @bloodyowl. Please refer to the
  [examples/reason-react-app](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/examples/reason-react-app)
  until API is stable & doc is complete.
