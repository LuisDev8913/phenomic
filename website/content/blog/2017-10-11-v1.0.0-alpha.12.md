## 🐛 Bugfixes

* [`@phenomic/reason`: Bring bsconfig.json to the npm package](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/b388e8ad0e17733898e09ec65eeba23617728e56),
  by @bloodyowl, reported by @bloodyowl (in
  [#1171](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/1171)) and @rickyvetter So
  now we can use reason package without any copy/paste/hack 🙃 Note that this
  package is going to be exploded as a `preset-reason` that will contains
  `plugin-renderer-reason` + `plugin-renderer-reason-react` in next release.

* [`@phenomic/api-client`: correctly handle url without path (and protect path from query by id)](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/bb2748162739faac0741637d111981bcab7569ef),
