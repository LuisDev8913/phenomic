We are on the road to final 1.0.0!

What is planned:

* We only plan to add an new generic API to fetch any kind of data (like `async
  getInitialProps` in Next.js) & a few minor improvements.
* We will also soon publish a few benchmarks between some well known others
  static site gen (that might reveal things‚Ä¶).
* We will try to add a bunch of plugins to show the world what Phenomic can
  really do.

If you have any question you can ask us on
[Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/phenomic) or on
